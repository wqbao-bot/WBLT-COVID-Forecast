# WBLT-COVID-Forecast
We examined the peak number of COVID-19 cases in the state of California and New York. Additionally, we also examined Los Angeles and New York City. We estimated the peak by forecasting the number of COVID-19 cases. We chose these states and cities because they are two of examples of states and cities most affected by the recent pandemic. Understanding the peak is useful for understanding how much our healthcare systems will be strained. Additionally, understanding the peak allows for examining when states should ease up on protective measures and reopening the economy.
